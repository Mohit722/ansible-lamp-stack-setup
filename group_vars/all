# Global variables

# Apache HTTP port
httpd_port: 80  # No change needed if using the default HTTP port

# Time synchronization server
ntpserver: 169.254.169.123  # This is the AWS NTP server for Amazon Linux instances




# httpd_port: No changes needed if you're using the default port 80 for HTTP services. 
# If you plan to change the port in the future, this variable can be easily updated.
# ntpserver: The previous ntpserver: 192.168.1.2 was likely a local NTP server in your network. 
# Since you're now working with AWS instances on Amazon Linux, 
# you should use 169.254.169.123, which is the default NTP server provided by AWS for its EC2 instances.
